# Formalization project for Logika v Računalništvu

See `src/Basic.lean` for an annotated collection of definitions and
theorems.

The repository has continuous integration, so the compilation log and
status of the latest commit is available.

Formalized small tasks:
- 1. definition of Catalan numbers
- 2. definition of plane trees
- 3. definition of full binary trees
- 4. full binary trees with `n` nodes

Formalized larger tasks:
- 1. distributivity of `Fin` and `Sigma`
- 2. counting Catalan numbers with `Fin`
- 3. counting full binary trees with `Cₙ` nodes
- 4. characterization of plane trees as a least fixed point of List
- 5. construction of the rotating isomorphism
